# Contributing

We love contributions and will happily review any pull requests. Please make sure to follow the instructions below!

## Getting Started

**Make sure to fork the repo first.**

## Code Style

Here on team Vuetron we strictly follow and enforce the [Javascript Semistandard](https://github.com/flet/semistandard) style.  Since we don't want to lose our beautiful badge in our README, please do the same for any pull requests you submit.

Repeat offenders will be added to the board of shame! (just kidding - or are we?)
